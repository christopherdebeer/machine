# DyGram Guides

Comprehensive guides for understanding and using DyGram effectively.

## Core Guides

### [Language Overview](language-overview.md)
High-level introduction to DyGram concepts including machines, nodes, edges, attributes, and basic syntax.

### [Syntax Guide](syntax-guide.md)
Complete language syntax reference with examples covering all language constructs and features.

### [Context and Schema Guide](context-and-schema-guide.md)
Enhanced context value management, schema validation, and data flow patterns.

### [Advanced Features](advanced-features.md)
Advanced language features including:
- Relationship types and semantic arrows
- Multiplicity and cardinality
- Annotations (@Abstract, @Singleton, @Async, etc.)
- Generic types
- Dependency inference
- Documentation notes

### [Edge Conditions](edge-conditions.md)
Conditional transitions using CEL (Common Expression Language) expressions for dynamic workflow control.

### [Meta-Programming](meta-programming.md)
Dynamic machine modification and self-evolving systems:
- Inspecting and modifying machine definitions
- Dynamic tool construction
- Runtime code generation
- Agent-driven evolution

## Testing and Validation

### [Testing Approach](testing-approach.md)
Testing methodology, best practices, and validation strategies for DyGram systems.

### [Generative Testing](generative-testing.md)
Using generative techniques to test and validate DyGram workflows with LLM-based execution.
