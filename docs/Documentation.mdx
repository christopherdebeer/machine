## üí° What Makes DyGram Special?

### Rapid Prototyping
Start with minimal, unstructured representations that are immediately executable. No need for complete specifications upfront.

### Iterative Evolution
Systems naturally evolve from explorative sketches to structured implementations through execution, feedback, and generative prompting.

### Rails-Based Execution
Your machine definition acts as "rails" guiding a single agent. Automated transitions for deterministic paths, agent decisions for complex branching.

### Cost Optimization
Tasks automatically evolve from flexible LLM execution to efficient generated code as patterns emerge, reducing costs over time.

### Meta-Programming
Agents can inspect and modify machine definitions at runtime, enabling self-evolving systems that adapt to changing requirements.

## Language Features Overview

### Basic Features
- **Nodes** - Basic building blocks with optional types (task, state, init, context)
- **Attributes** - Typed and untyped metadata on nodes
- **Edges** - Transitions with labels, conditions, and multiple arrow styles
- **Nesting** - Hierarchical structures with unlimited depth
- **Context** - Shared configuration and state
- **Unicode Support** - Full internationalization for identifiers and labels

### Advanced Features
- **Relationship Types** - 7 semantic arrow types (association, dependency, inheritance, composition, aggregation, bidirectional, emphasis)
- **Multiplicity** - Cardinality expressions (1, *, 0..1, 1..*, ranges)
- **Annotations** - Semantic metadata (@Abstract, @Singleton, @Async, @Deprecated, @Critical)
- **Dependency Inference** - Automatic detection from template variables
- **Generic Types** - Parameterized types (Promise\<T\>, Array\<T\>, Map\<K,V\>)
- **Documentation Notes** - Inline notes attached to nodes
- **Type Checking** - Attribute type validation and inference
- **Graph Validation** - Reachability, cycles, orphans, entry/exit points
- **Semantic Validation** - Node type rules and annotation compatibility

See [Advanced Features](guides/advanced-features.md) for details.

## Transformation Pipeline

DyGram supports transformations to multiple output formats:
```
DyGram source ‚Üí AST ‚Üí JSON ‚Üí Mermaid diagrams
```

All transformations are validated for:
- **Completeness** - No information lost during parsing
- **Losslessness** - Round-trip transformations preserve semantics
- **Validity** - Output formats are syntactically correct
