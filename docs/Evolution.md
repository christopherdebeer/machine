                        From LLM Exploration to Optimized Code







## Intelligent Task Evolution



                        DyGram tasks automatically evolve from flexible LLM-based execution to efficient,
                        cost-effective code as patterns emerge from repeated use.

### START EXPLORING



                                Begin with pure LLM execution. High flexibility, rapid prototyping,
                                zero upfront code.

### AUTOMATIC LEARNING



                                System observes execution patterns, tracks success rates,
                                and identifies opportunities for code generation.

### EVOLVE TO CODE



                                After 100+ successful executions at 90%+ success rate,
                                tasks automatically generate TypeScript code.







## Four Evolution Stages



                        Tasks transition through four stages, each optimizing the balance between
                        flexibility and performance.






                                01

### LLM ONLY




                                **Pure exploration phase**


                                Every execution uses the LLM. Highest flexibility and adaptability.
                                Gathers execution history for pattern learning.




```
Task classify {
    prompt: "Classify: {{ input }}";
    evolution_stage: "llm_only";

```



                                    **Best for:** Prototyping, exploring new domains, handling unpredictable inputs






                                02

### HYBRID




                                **Learning phase with safety net**


                                Generated code handles common cases. Falls back to LLM when confidence
                                is below 80%. Balances cost and flexibility.




```
Task classify {
    evolution_stage: "hybrid";
    code_path: "generated/classify_v123.ts";

```



                                    **Best for:** Emerging patterns, gradual optimization, edge case handling






                                03

### CODE FIRST




                                **Optimization phase**


                                Code handles most executions. LLM only assists when code confidence
                                drops below threshold (default 70%). Low cost with safety net.




```
Task classify {
    evolution_stage: "code_first";
    code_path: "generated/classify_v456.ts";
    llm_threshold: "0.7";

```



                                    **Best for:** Mature patterns with occasional edge cases, cost optimization






                                04

### CODE ONLY




                                **Full maturity phase**


                                Pure code execution with no LLM fallback. Fastest performance,
                                lowest cost, deterministic behavior.




```
Task classify {
    evolution_stage: "code_only";
    code_path: "generated/classify_v789.ts";

```



                                    **Best for:** Well-understood domains, production workloads, cost-sensitive operations






## Key Features





### AUTOMATIC CODE GENERATION



                                System analyzes execution history and generates type-safe TypeScript code
                                with confidence scoring and proper error handling.







### BROWSER-COMPATIBLE STORAGE



                                IndexedDB, localStorage, and memory backends with unified API.
                                Automatically selects best available storage.







### MACHINE VERSIONING



                                Full version control with rollback capability. Track machine evolution
                                over time with performance metrics.







### PATTERN LIBRARY



                                Save and reuse learned behaviors across machines. Build a library
                                of proven patterns for common tasks.







### PERFORMANCE TRACKING



                                Monitor execution time, success rate, cost per execution,
                                and evolution history for all tasks.







### MANUAL EVOLUTION



                                Trigger evolution on-demand with `triggerEvolution()`
                                when you want control over the process.








## Example Usage



                            {`import { EvolutionaryExecutor } from 'dygram/language/task-evolution';
import { createStorage } from 'dygram/language/storage';

// Setup with automatic storage selection
const storage = createStorage();
const executor = new EvolutionaryExecutor(machineData, {}, storage);

// Execute many times - evolution happens automatically
for (let i = 0; i < 500; i++) {
    await executor.step();

// Check which tasks evolved
const mutations = executor.getMutations();
const evolutions = mutations.filter(m => m.type === 'task_evolution');
console.log(\`\${evolutions.length} tasks evolved\`);`}




## Benefits





### REDUCED COSTS



                                Tasks evolve from expensive LLM calls to free code execution.
                                Save 90%+ on API costs for mature workflows.







### FASTER EXECUTION



                                Code execution is 10-100x faster than LLM calls.
                                Mature tasks run in milliseconds instead of seconds.







### IMPROVED RELIABILITY



                                Generated code is deterministic and type-safe.
                                No more waiting for LLM responses or handling API errors.







### GRADUAL OPTIMIZATION



                                Evolution is automatic and gradual. Start prototyping immediately,
                                optimize production workloads over time.







### REUSABLE PATTERNS



                                Build a library of proven patterns. Share learned behaviors
                                across projects and teams.







### FULL TRANSPARENCY



                                Track metrics, inspect generated code, and understand
                                exactly when and why tasks evolve.
