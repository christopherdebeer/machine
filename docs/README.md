## What is DyGram?

DyGram is a domain-specific language that enables rapid prototyping through:

- **Immediate Execution** - Start with minimal sketches that run immediately
- **Iterative Evolution** - Refine through execution and feedback
- **Rails-Based Architecture** - Guide agents with deterministic state machines
- **Cost Optimization** - Evolve from flexible LLM execution to efficient code

## Documentation Philosophy

This documentation is organized by purpose:

- **Syntax** - Language reference for what you can write
- **CLI** - Tools reference for how to use the command line
- **API** - Library reference for programmatic integration
- **Examples** - Practical patterns for common scenarios

Each section is designed to stand alone while providing cross-references to related topics.
