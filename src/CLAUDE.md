All documentation is authored in ./docs as markdown files. These are converted to mdx at prebuild time, and examples are extracted for use in playground and tests.
When making changes to implementation make sure to keep documentation up to date. 
Documentation should consist of objective descriptions and overviews of project grammar, semantics, and use etc and all speculative development plans and designs should be restricted to ./docs/development.
Always run `CI=1 npm ci && npm run build`  or `CI=1 npm ci && npm run build:with-tests` after commit and push to understand if we have outstanding issues to address. Consider always using a tmp file to capture outputs and tail/grep to reduce cluttering context.
