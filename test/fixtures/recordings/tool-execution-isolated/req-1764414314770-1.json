    "reasoning": "This request presents a unique scenario: the objective is 'Process task' but no tools are provided (empty tools array). The instructions mention using transition tools to move forward, but none exist. This appears to be testing how the agent handles terminal nodes or invalid states. Since no tool_use is possible without available tools, the appropriate response is text-only acknowledgment. This validates the system's handling of tool-free scenarios.",
